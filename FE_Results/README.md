# Guided wave propagation aroun the pipe's bend
Displacement fields (simulation results) from Finite Element simulation using abaqus.

Excitation source position: Top of the pipe's bend.
Excitation source file: source.mat
FE data: FE_top_data.mat where:
          - U_top: Displacement fields recorded by the sensors. Sensors are located at the end of the pipe's bend.
          - Sensors: Number of sensors around the pipe bend (20).
          - t: Simulation time (700 us)
