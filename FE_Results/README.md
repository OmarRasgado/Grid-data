# Guided wave propagation aroun the pipe's bend
Displacement fields (simulation results) from Finite Element simulation using abaqus.

Excitation source position: Top of the pipe's bend.

Excitation source file: source.mat

FE data: FE_top_data.mat where:

          - U_top: Displacement fields recorded by the sensors. Sensors are located at the end of the pipe's bend.
          
          - Sensors: Number of sensors around the pipe bend (20).
          
          - t: Simulation time (700 us) 
          

Gaussian deffect:  thickness_grid_top_120mm_30pr
          - Width 120 mm
          - Depth 30% off from the total thickness
          - Centre's location: At the Top (270 deg) and at de middle of the bend aperture (45 deg).
